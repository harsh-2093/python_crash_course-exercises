# Python Crash Course – Part 1

I recently completed **Part 1 of Eric Matthes’ Python Crash Course** 📘.  
Here’s my experience and why I found reading a book more effective than YouTube tutorials:

## Why a Book Worked Better for Me
- **Structured Learning** – The book follows a clear path step by step.  
- **Deeper Focus** – Reading makes me think and write code myself instead of passively watching.  
- **Exercises & Practice** – The book includes exercises that actually test my understanding.  
- **Better Retention** – Since I solved problems instead of copy-pasting, I remember concepts much better.  

## What’s in This Repo
- All my exercise solutions from Part 1 of the book.  
- Step-by-step practice files as I worked through the chapters.  

## Next Steps
I’ll start **Part 2 (Projects)** soon, where I’ll build:
- A simple 2D game 🎮  
- A data visualization project 📊  
- A small web app 🌐  

Stay tuned 🚀
